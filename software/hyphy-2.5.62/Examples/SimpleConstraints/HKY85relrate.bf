/* This is an example HY-PHY Batch File.   It reads in a PHYLIP nucleotide dataset data/3.seq and performs   the relative rate test on the 3-taxa tree, using HKY85 model.      Output is printed out as a Newick Style tree with branch lengths   representing the number of expected substitutions per branch (which   is the default setting for nucleotide models w/o rate variation).   Also, the likelihood ratio statistic is evaluated and the P-value   for the test is reported.         Sergei L.
